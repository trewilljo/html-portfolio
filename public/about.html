<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Aastha Joshi — a cloud computing student with a strong interest in
  front-end web development and user-centered design. I’ve worked on projects
  like building characters for an inclusive GUI game for disabled users and
  designing interfaces for SaaS applications, where I collaborated closely with
  developers and contributed to user experience planning.
</p>

<p>
  My passion lies in creating clean, accessible, and responsive interfaces that
  solve real problems. With a growing skill set in front-end technologies and
  cloud tools, I enjoy exploring how design and code come together to build
  seamless digital experiences.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, I’m focused on enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
  cloud platforms. I’m always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful
  projects that make a difference.
